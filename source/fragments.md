A fragment is a piece of schema, usually used to define what data you want to query for.

## Registering Fragments

You can register fragments by passing the fragment string to `registerFragment`:

```js
import { registerFragment } from 'meteor/vulcan:core';

registerFragment(`
  fragment PostsList on Post {
    _id
    title
    url
    slug
  }
`);
```

## Using Fragments

You can get a fragment with:

```js
import { getFragment } from 'meteor/vulcan:lib';

getFragment('PostsList');
```

## Sub-Fragments

When registering a fragment, you'll often want to use sub-fragments to avoid repeating frequently used properties. For example, the `PostsList` fragment uses the `UserMinimumInfo` fragment:

```js
registerFragment(`
  fragment PostsList on Post {
    # vulcan:posts
    _id
    title
    url
    slug
    user {
      ...UsersMinimumInfo
    }
  }
`);
```

Note that in “regular” Apollo code, you need to include any sub-fragment used by a fragment [as tagged template literal](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/fragments.html#reusing-fragments), but Vulcan takes care of this for you (provided you've previously registered any sub-fragment using `registerFragment`).

## Extending Fragments

You often need to add one or more properties to a fragment without modifying its existing properties. You can do this with `extendFragment`:

```js
import { extendFragment } from 'meteor/vulcan:lib';

extendFragment(
  'PostsList',
  `
  color # new custom property!
`
);
```

This is the same as registering the entire `PostsList` fragment with `color` tacked on at the end.

## Replacing Fragments

To replace a fragment completely, you can just register it again under the same name.

```js
import { registerFragment } from 'meteor/vulcan:lib';

registerFragment(`
  fragment UsersMinimumInfo on User {
    _id
    slug
    username
    # displayName # remove this
    # emailHash # and this
    mySuperCustomProperty # but add this
  }
`);
```

Note that you can replace both “regular” fragments and sub-fragments.

## Default Fragments

Every collection automatically gets a default fragment associated with it called `FooDefaultFragment` (for example `PostsDefaultFragment`).

This default fragment simply contain all fields where `viewableBy` is defined (in other words, all public fields). Note that it **does not** follow field resolvers, meaning that the default fragment will e.g. include `userId` but not `user`.

#### Alternative Approach

You can use standard Apollo fragments at any point in your Vulcan app (passing them as `fragment` instead of `fragmentName`), but be aware that you will lose the ability to extend and replace fragments. You will also need to [manually specify](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/fragments.html#reusing-fragments) sub-fragments.
