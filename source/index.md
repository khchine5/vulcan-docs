## What's Vulcan?

Vulcan is a framework that gives you a set of tools for quickly building React & GraphQL-based web applications. Out of the box, it can handle data loading, automatically generate forms, handle email notifications, and much more. 

## Why Vulcan?

Vulcan is unique in that it spans the full stack, from the database to the browser. While there exists many excellent back-end frameworks or backend-as-a-service providers, these all still require you to handle your front-end code yourself, including building a set of components to read, write, and display data. 

But because Vulcan is full-stack, it's able to speed up these repetitive tasks by providing a whole range of helper components that are fine-tuned to the Vulcan back-end, and as a result just work out of the box. 

You can get a good overview of what Vulcan can do in the [Features](features.html) section. 

## Install

- [Full video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCjR9UrNqVk)

In order to run a Vulcan project, we'll need to first install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/):

1. Install the latest version of Node and NPM. We recommend the usage of [NVM](http://nvm.sh).

2. You can then install [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install), which is used as the Vulcan build tool.

3. Clone the [Vulcan Starter repo](https://github.com/VulcanJS/Vulcan-Starter) locally.

4. Run:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

And open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

Note that you can also start the app with:

```sh
meteor --settings sample_settings.json 
```

All `npm start` does is run the above command, while also checking for the presence of `settings.json` first and creating it for you if missing. 

## Two-Repo Install (Optional)

In order to make working with Vulcan easier (especially when it comes to updating the core packages), you can also follow the more complicated "two-repo" pattern, with the two repositories being: 

1. Your own Vulcan project (for example, a clone of the Vulcan Starter project as outlined above).
2. A clone of [the main Vulcan repo](https://github.com/VulcanJS/Vulcan/), which the first repo will use as the source for the Vulcan core code. 

Follow these steps to get set up:

1. Clone the main [VulcanJS repo](https://github.com/VulcanJS/Vulcan) locally (for example, to `~/Vulcan`).
2. Create a new Meteor project or clone the [Vulcan starter repo](https://github.com/VulcanJS/Vulcan-Starter) (this will become your project's repo).
3. Inside your project repo, launch Vulcan with:

```
METEOR_PACKAGE_DIRS="/Users/sacha/Vulcan/packages" meteor --port 3000 --settings settings.json
```

(Taking care to adapt the `/Users/sacha/Vulcan/packages` path to point to your Vulcan core repo's `/packages` directory)

If you'd like, you can also export `METEOR_PACKAGE_DIRS` as a global variable for all your Meteor apps. In your `.bash_profile` file or equivalent, just add:

```
export METEOR_PACKAGE_DIRS="/Users/sacha/Vulcan/packages"
```

If you'd like to add more than one source directory (for example, one for Vulcan packages, and one for other Meteor packages), you can separate them with a `:`:

```
export METEOR_PACKAGE_DIRS="/Users/sacha/Vulcan/packages:/Users/sacha/meteor-packages"
```

### Git-Based Deploys

If you follow this install method, your Vulcan core files will *not* be included in the same Git repository as your "main" app. This can cause issues when using Git-based deploy methods such as Heroku. Either use deploy methods that bundle the whole app first (such as Meteor Up or Galaxy), or else add your core files as a Git submodule instead.

## Getting Started

When you first run VulcanJS, you'll see the contents of the `example-simple` package. It is recommended you go through the [Simple Example tutorial](example-simple.html) to get a grasp of how Vulcan's building blocks (data loading, forms, etc.) work. 

You can then take the more in-depth [Movies Example tutorial](example-movies.html) to get a better understanding of VulcanJS's internals. You can enable the Movies Example package by uncommenting it in `.meteor/packages`, and commenting out `example-simple` in its place)

Once you've gone through both tutorials, you can enable the `example-instagram` package, which takes the same basic example but goes a little further, as well as take a look at its code. 

At this stage, you can either continue using Vulcan's basic building blocks, or enable the more advanced forum features by checking out the [`example-forum`](example-forum.html) package. 

And if you'd like to use and customize the forum packages, you can then follow up with the [customization example tutorial](example-customization.html) tutorial, which will take you through the code of the included `example-customization` package and show you how to adapt Vulcan packages to your needs without modifying their code directly, by tweaking styles, overriding components, and inserting your own logic in Vulcan's back-end. 

You can also check out [Vulcan's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGIvQQ6zw7ov2cHgD70HFlA) to learn more about the framework. 

## Slack Channel

Vulcan has a pretty active [Slack channel](http://slack.vulcanjs.org/) where you can ask for support, share ideas, and get tips. 

## Roadmap

You can find the [Vulcan roadmap on Trello](https://trello.com/b/dwPR0LTz/nova-roadmap).
