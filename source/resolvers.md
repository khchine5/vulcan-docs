title: Resolvers
---

A resolver is the function on the server that receives a GraphQL query, decides what to do with it (how to _resolve_ it), and then returns some data.

Each level of a GraphQL query (in other words, each field) can have its own custom resolver; or if no resolver exists the field will default to look for a value on its parent object.

## Data Flow

When you connect to a GraphQL-powered site, the client makes an API request to load the data it needs.

Unlike traditional REST APIs, the client doesn't just hit an API endpoint but actually sends a list of _what data it needs_ to the server. The specific document properties needed by the client are defined in a [fragment](/fragments.html).

Upon receiving that query, the server checks that the main query exists in the [GraphQL schema](/graphql-schema.html), and also validates the fragment against it.

If that validation passes, the server then looks for a **query resolver function** that will specify how to actually retrieve the data (presumably through some kind of database `find()` operation).

It will then take that data, strip any fields not specified in the fragment, and return the result to the client.

### Implicit Resolvers

Technically speaking, every single field in the fragment has to resolve to _something_. But if for example you've specified a `Post` resolver and you're asking for a post's `title` and `createdAt` properties, GraphQL will be smart enough to look for `post.title` and `post.createdAt` without you needing to define additional resolvers for these two fields.

That being said if you wanted `createdAt` to resolve to, say, `formatDate(post.createdAt)` instead of just `post.createdAt`, then you could write a custom resolver [just for that specific field](/field-resolvers.html).

## Collection Resolvers

As a time-saving convention, Vulcan makes the assumption that you as a developer will provide it with three "default" resolvers:

* `list`: used to return a list of documents matching a set of arguments
* `total`: used to return the _total number_ of documents matching a set of arguments
* `single`: used to return a single document matching an `_id` or `slug`

You can pass a `resolver` object to `createCollection` when initializing your collection. It should include these three `list`, `single`, and `total` resolvers.

Each resolver should have the following properties:

* `name`: the resolver's name.
* `resolver`: the resolver function.

Note that if the collections include private data, you'll have to implement your own security layer inside each resolver to prevent unwanted access. Check out the [Controlling Viewing](/groups-permissions.html#Controlling-Viewing) section for more details.

### List Resolver

The `list` resolver is used to display lists of documents. It takes the following arguments:

* `terms`: a JSON object containing a list of terms used to filter and sort the list.
* `offset`: how many documents to offset the list by (used for paginating requests).
* `limit`: how many documents to return.

It should return an array of documents.

### Single Resolver

The `single` resolver takes a `documentId` argument, and should return a single document.

### List Total Resolver

The `total` resolver takes a `terms` argument and should return the total count of results matching these terms in the database.

### Default Resolvers

Vulcan provides a set of default List, Single and Total resolvers you can use to save time by calling `getDefaultResolvers(collectionName)`:

```js
import {
  createCollection,
  getDefaultResolvers,
  getDefaultMutations
} from 'meteor/vulcan:core';
import schema from './schema.js';

const Movies = createCollection({
  collectionName: 'Movies',

  typeName: 'Movie',

  schema,

  resolvers: getDefaultResolvers('Movies'),

  mutations: getDefaultMutations('Movies')
});

export default Movies;
```

To learn more about what exactly the default resolvers do, you can [find their code here](https://github.com/VulcanJS/Vulcan/blob/devel/packages/vulcan-core/lib/modules/default_resolvers.js).

## Custom Resolvers

In some cases, you will want to go beyond the three default resolvers. For example, you might want to create a resolver that returns a single random post, or the current user. You can do so by using `addGraphQLResolvers` and `addGraphQLQuery`:

```js
import { addGraphQLResolvers, addGraphQLQuery } from 'meteor/vulcan:core';

const currentUserResolver = {
  Query: {
    currentUser(root, args, context) {
      return context.Users.findOne({ _id: args.userId });
    }
  }
};
addGraphQLResolvers(currentUserResolver);

addGraphQLQuery(`currentUser: User`);
```

`addGraphQLResolvers` adds the actual resolver function, while `addGraphQLQuery` adds the corresponding **query type** (if your new resolver is not mentioned in your GraphQL schema, you won't be able to query it).

Learn more about resolvers in the [Apollo documentation](http://dev.apollodata.com/tools/graphql-tools/resolvers.html).

## Higher-Order Components

To make working with Apollo easier, Vulcan provides you with a set of higher-order components (HoCs).

An **HoC** is simply a function you can call on a React component to give it additional props. Think of it as a mechanic's assistant following along with a little toolbox, ready to hand over a screwdriver or socket wrench at the appropriate time.

### withList

The `withList` HoC is used to display lists of documents. It takes the following options:

* `queryName`: an arbitrary name for the query.
* `collection`: the collection on which to look for the `list` resolver.
* `fragment` or `fragmentName`: the fragment to use. If you pass `fragmentName` instead of `fragment`, the name you passed will be used to look up a fragment registered with `registerFragment`.

For example:

```js
const listOptions = {
  collection: Movies,
  queryName: 'moviesListQuery',
  fragment: MoviesItem.fragment
};

export default withList(listOptions)(MoviesList);
```

The resulting wrapped component also takes in the following options:

* `terms`: an object containing a list of querying, sorting, and filtering terms.

Note that `terms` needs to be passed not as an option, but as a prop from the _parent_ component.

The HoC then passes on the following props:

* `loading`: `true` while the data is loading.
* `results`: the loaded array of documents.
* `totalCount`: the total count of results.
* `count`: the number of current results (i.e. `results.length`).
* `refetch`: a function that can be called to trigger a query refetch.
* `loadMore`: a function that can be called to load more data.

### withDocument

The `withDocument` HoC displays a single document. It takes the same options as `withList`, but takes a `documentId` **prop**.

Like `terms` for `withList`, `documentId` needs to be passed not as an option, but as a prop from the _parent_ component.

This HoC then passes on the following child prop:

* `loading`: `true` while the data is loading.
* `document`: the loaded document.

### Data Updating

As long as you use `withList` in conjunction with `withNew`, `withEdit`, and `withRemove`, your lists will automatically be updated after any mutation. This includes:

* Inserting new items in lists after they're inserted.
* Removing items when they're removed.
* Reordering lists when an item is edited in a way that changes a sort.
* Removing an item after it's been edited when it doesn't match a list's filters anymore.

At this time, it's only possible to benefit from this auto-updating behavior if you're using the three built-in mutation HoCs, although making `withList` more flexible towards custom mutations is on the roadmap (PRs welcome!).

#### Alternative Approach

You can replace any of Vulcan's generic HoCs with your own tailor-made HoCs (whether it is for queries or mutations) using the `graphql` utility. Note that if you do so, you will need to manually [update your queries](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/cache-updates.html) after each mutation.
